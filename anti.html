        While you may think that a targeted spoofing attack against you may never happen, it doesn't hurt to take some
        time out of your day to protect yourself from spoofing attacks. There are a couple of quick things you could do
        to reduce your risk. The first is to set some simple verification processes for your accounts so it'll be
        harder the attacker to get access to your personal information.

        Another method for anti-spoofing is the use of
        multi-modal biometric systems. Basically what this is, is a way of combining several biometric types into one
        single biometric system. An example of this would be to combine facial recognition with fingerprint
        recognition. This would make it pretty difficult for the attacker to gain access as they would need a very high
        quality facial image and fingerprint which would be difficult for the attackers to obtain. These two examples
        are only some of the many ways to protect yourself againts spoofing attacks.
