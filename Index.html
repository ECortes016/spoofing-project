            When communication from an unknown source, disguised as a source to the known reciever is known as
            'Spoofing,' which is commonly used on devices that don't have high security to keep them protected. Even
            though a targeted attack against you may not happen, it is always safe to be protected so you can reduce
            your risk as much as possible.
