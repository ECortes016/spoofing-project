            Spoofing is known as the act to disguise as a communication source from a known and trusted source.
            Spoofing can apply to many things such as emails, phone calls, and websites, they can even be more
            technical, such as computer spoofing an IP address, Address Resolution Protocol (ARP), or Domain Name
            System
            (DNS) server. Spoofing can be used for malicious intents such as gaining access to the targets personal
            information, spreading malware through infected links or attachments, or to bypass network access
            controls. Attacks that happen to be successful on an organization can lead to infected computer systems
            and networks, data breaches, or loss of revenue. Spoofing that leads to the rerouting of internet traffic
            can lead customers or clients to malicious sites aimed towards stealing their information or
            distributing malware.
