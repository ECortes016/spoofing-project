                <li>ARP Spoofing</li>
            </h2>
            <p>
                ARP Spoofing occurs when the attacker links their MAC address with the IP address of a company’s
                network, this would then let the attacker intercept any data intended for the company’s computer. ARP
                Spoofing is commonly led to theft or deletion of data, stolen accounts, and other malicious intents
                that the attacker wants to accomplish.

            <h2>
                <li>DNS Spoofing</li>
            </h2>
            <p>
                DNS Spoofing occurs when the attacker is able to successfully reroute the users DNS translation so that
                it points to a different server, which in most cases, is infected with malware and is also used to
                spread viruses and worms into your computer creating problems that you’ll have to deal with.

            <h2>
                <li>IP Spoofing</li>
            </h2>
            <p>
                The most commonly-used spoofing is known as IP Spoofing. This type of spoofing attack is successful
                when the malicious party successfully copies an actual real IP which then forces devices to believe
                that the source is indeed trustworthy. The most popular type of IP spoofing attack that is achieved is
                known as a Denial of Service attack, or DoS. This attack basically lets the attacker overwhelm the
                victims server and shut them down. Attackers using IP spoofing are then able to perform this Denial of
                Service attack. If the attacker were to successfully lands a DoS attack, their most probable reason
                would be to shut down your machine or network making it inaccessible for you to use.
